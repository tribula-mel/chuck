Chuckie Egg reimplementation for modern Linux systems.

The idea is to mimic the original game as much as possible. Hopefully in time
the code will see the finish line.

Apart from the code itself the repository carries some Chuckie Egg statistics
(CPC464 game version played on XMESS) and also some analysis for the cpc464
and bbc game versions.
